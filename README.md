The [Mapbox Vector Tile spec](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/) is an efficient encoding for map
data into vector tiles that can be rendered dynamically.

### Parsers & Generators

- [vector-tile-js](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) - Parses vector tiles with JavaScript.

- [node-mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik) - Node.js API for vector tiles which depends on `mapnik-vector-tile`
- [mapbox-vector-tile-cs](https://github.com/bertt/mapbox-vector-tile-cs) - Parses vector tiles with C#.
- [tilelive-bridge](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-bridge) - Implements [Tilelive API](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive.js/blob/master/API.md) for creating vector tiles from traditional Mapnik datasources in Node.js.
- [tilelive-vector](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-vector) - Implements [Tilelive API](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive.js/blob/master/API.md) for reading vector tiles and rendering to image tiles in Node.js.
- [mapbox-vector-tile](https://github.com/mapzen/mapbox-vector-tile) is a Python package for vector tile encoding maintained by Mapzen. (It is used in Mapzen's [vector tile service](http://mapzen.com/vector)).
- [geojson-vt](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt) - Slice GeoJSON into vector tiles on the fly in the browser.

- [cached-vector-tile](https://github.com/developmentseed/cached-vector-tile) - An alternative implementation of the vector-tile-js interface, backed by plain JS objects/arrays rather than parsed-on-demand protobuf data. Trades away memory efficiency for faster feature.loadGeometry() calls.
- [tilegrinder](https://github.com/rastapasta/tilegrinder) - A helper library for applying a data altering function on each vector tile in an MBTiles, using the native protobuf wrapper for de- and encoding, recompressing the results and storing them either in an MBTiles or as single files.
